Opencast PHP Library Upgrade Guide
====================

1.1.1 to 1.2.0
----------

From 1.2.0 the base class name "OpencastApi\OpenCast" with capital "C" has been changed to "Opencast", it is highly recommended to apply this change accordingly as it might lead to PHP runtime error in some strict cases!
